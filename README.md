---

**Created by** Joshua Andreasian, Anthony Navarro, Yixuan Leng, Kenneth Jun


**Abstract**  

Teach Me is a convenient Android app for students to easily find tutors for the classes they need help in and for tutors to post the classes they are qualified to tutor. By allowing students and tutors to message, search, and rate each other in the app and set appointments based on their proximity to each other, Teach Me will take the frustration of finding a good tutor out of the equation.
